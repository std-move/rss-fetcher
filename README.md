# RSS fetcher

This repository currently provides a feed of "bigTop" WSJ articles from section World. These Big Top articles are usually well researched and interesting, however there is no official feed for them. The feed is created by fetching WSJ's World News RSS feed and filtering it, leaving in only these in-depth articles. Only data that is in the original feed gets into the filtered feed - no scraping/article text extraction is attempted.

The feed is present in branch gh-pages and is updated every 2 hours.
